This application is for exploring all the posibilities to be active in the city of Sarajevo.

It will give the user a choice to select a certain type of activity, indoor or outdoor.
When an activity is selected it will generate a list with all the possible locations or facilities the user can choose from.

Later, the user can make a reservation (*if necessary*), in one of the facilities that has an available opening.
